The Property Manager
====================

The checkboxes next to each item in the Attributes section refer to which
options will be saved when a project is written out.  When a widget is created,
the options it has are mostly all defaults.  If you change or edit the values
of these options from the defaults, the checkbox will automatically check
itself to signify that that particular option should be saved with the project.

You can explicity tell vTcl not to save an option by turning off its checkbox.
