The Widget Tree
===============

The widget tree displays all widgets in the current project.  It displays
them in a tree style, showing each widget as a parent or children of other
widgets in the project.

Clicking on the button for a particular widget will set the focus on that
widget and raise the toplevel window of the widget to the top of the
work area.

If a toplevel window is hidden, clicking its button in the widget tree will
deiconify it and raise it.
